# Austin's Favorite Meetups

## Overview

- This React application was built using create-react-app, and interacts with the Meetup V3 api. Requiring a user access token, a Meetup member can view my favorite Meetup groups, as well as event information, RSVP information, and similar groups.

- This app has continuous integration using Circle CI. The application will not deploy wihout all tests passing. Tests are written using Jest and Enzyme.

- Additionally, this app uses Redux, and React Router. Redux is certainly not critical for an app this small, but it is a good example of my practice of Redux.
